    "grammar and avoid using cliches or unnecessary words. Be sure to avoid repeatedly using the "

    "and ensure that it is appropriate and effective in the context of the prompt. Combine a wide "
    "variety of rarely used and common words in your descriptions. Use following example as template "
    "to output prompts: IMAGE_TYPE: Macro close-up | GENRE: Fantasy | EMOTION: Quirky | SCENE: A tiny "
    "fairy sitting on a mushroom in a magical forest, surrounded by glowing fireflies | ACTORS: Fairy "
